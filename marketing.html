                                        selling in a foreign country, it is necessary to know the relevant language. If the sales person speaks to the buyer in his mother tongue, the client connects better to the product. In an increasingly globalized
                                        world, knowing a foreign language helps to add that extra line to oneâ€™s resume. It also makes an individual appear to be more accommodative to prospective employers. The market scope of a foreign language skill
                                        is virtually endless. Infinite job opportunities in diverse fields open up for a person who is conversant in a foreign language – be it the technology industry (where one needs to regularly interact with offshore
                                        clients/counterparts) or the BPO sector (where one is required to interact with culturally diverse people) or Trade Industry (which involves imports/exports these days considering Indiaâ€™s â€˜global economyâ€™
                                        model). Language being the main obstacle (when lack it) and, at the same time, the main instrument (when we own it) in understanding the people of other countries and cultures. The University in association with
